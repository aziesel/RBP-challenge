# RBP-challenge
Work performed by our team to characterize RNA binding targets of the human protein PRPF17/CDC40.

This repository contains the work product produced by each phase of our analysis. All utilities used are publicly, freely available and many are offered as web servers, simplifying analysis for those labs without appropriate computer hardware to run analyses locally.
